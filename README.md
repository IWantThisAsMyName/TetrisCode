## Controls
- Left arrow: move piece left
- Right arrow: move piece right
- Up arrow: rotate piece OR increase level
- Down arrow: soft drop piece OR decrease level
- Space bar: hard (instant) drop piece
- Esc: pause/unpause
- C: hold piece/unhold piece
- Enter: start game
## Most Basic Rules
- Can only move pieces left and right along with rotation and instant dropping
- Game is over once pieces reach the top of the screen
- Can only remove pieces once all space in a line is filled
- More lines cleared = faster pace
### Scoring Rules
- 1 line cleared: 100 x lvl
- 2 lines cleared: 300 x lvl
- 3 lines cleared: 500 x lvl
- 4 lines cleared: 800 x lvl
>You also get points for soft and hard dropping!
- Soft: 1 point per cell covered
- Hard: 2 points per cell covered
## Menu Screen

>This is what you first see when you run the project. Notice that there are two sections in the menu screen: mode and level (lvl). Mode is always set to A as we have yet to create a mode B, so you can ignore that section. Levels can be increased via up key and decreased via down key. The minimum level is 1 and maximum is 19. The higher the level, the faster the pieces drop (stronger gravity). However, you also get more points for clearing lines at a higher level. Once the level has been selected, press enter to begin the game!
